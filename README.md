# CellPhone Management System

This Java project manages a list of cell phones using linked lists. It provides functionality to read cell phone data from a file, manipulate the list of phones, and perform various operations on them.

## Description

This project consists of three main classes:

1. **CellPhone**: Represents a mobile phone with attributes such as serial number, brand, manufacturing year, and price.

2. **CellList**: Represents a linked list of CellPhone objects, providing methods to manipulate the list.

3. **CellListUtilization**: Demonstrates the usage of CellList and CellPhone classes, including reading cell phone information from a file, populating a list, and performing operations on the phones.

## Features

- Read cell phone information from a file.
- Populate a linked list with cell phone data.
- Add, insert, delete, and replace cell phones in the list.
- Search for a cell phone by serial number.
- Clone a cell phone.
- Compare cell phones for equality.

## Usage

1. **Run the program**: Execute the CellListUtilization class.
2. **Input file format**: The `cell_info.txt` file contains data about cell phones in the following format:
   <serialNumber> <brand> <price> <year>
   
## Sample Data

The sample `cell_info.txt` file contains data about cell phones. Each line represents a cell phone with serial number, brand, price, and manufacturing year.
